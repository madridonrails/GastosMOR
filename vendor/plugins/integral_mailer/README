== Integral Mailer

Integral Mailer is a Ruby on Rails plugin that lets you send email to remote hosts without the aid of a full-blown MTA like Sendmail. It works by doing a lookup of the MX server for the destination email and delivering the message directly to that mail server.

Thanks to Dan Kubb's new MXLookup.for_domain() implementation, the dependency on the 'dig' command line tool has been removed. Integral Mailer should now be cross-platform.

Right now it's experimental, and probably more useful in a development environment. However, if you use it in production please be sure to let me know of your success (or lack thereof).

== Installation

./script/plugin install http://svn.integralserver.com/plugins/integral_mailer

or, if you're using svn and would rather add it as an external:

./script/plugin install -x http://svn.integralserver.com/plugins/integral_mailer

== Configuration

The goal was to keep the configuration as simple as possible. You can start sending mail by adding one line to environment.rb:

config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :integral_mailer

However, you should probably also add a second line which sets the value for the "HELO" command when connecting to the remote SMTP host. The value should be your domain name.

config.action_mailer.server_settings = { :helo => 'foo.com' }

== Reverse DNS

This isn’t specific to Integral Mailer, but you should also make sure you have reverse DNS setup properly for the IP address you’re running this on. Otherwise, some mail servers will refuse to accept your mail (or give you a high spam score). Setting up reverse DNS usually involves sending an email request to your hosting provider.

== Troubleshooting

You'll notice a new log file in your 'log' directory called integral_mailer.log. If you have any trouble sending mail, check this log for errors.

One common issue is that some ISPs block all outgoing traffic on port 25. If this is the case for you, and you can't have that "feature" turned off, you're screwed. This won't work for you and there's no way around it.
